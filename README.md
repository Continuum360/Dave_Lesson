For my next trick I will figure out how Github works more seamlessly with Linux, since downloading a Zip
file seems stupid.

A simple guess for the first step is, not surprisingly to install git.  I think Woohoo - more good guesses, i am on a roll this morning.  The clone box creates the needed arguments for the git command.  And again, very straight forward assumption "git clone" is the base.

Now, i think it can happen automatically if I supply ssh public key.

"#" Was just for the title - duh

OK, so these changes are from VSC on Ubuntu - first changes were all lost i believe because I changed master after downloading/cloneing the project locally.  Probably can do that somehow, but at this point it was easier to clean up and start again.  I don't think VSC was syncing here yet any way, but now it probably is because I got that question about checking periodically.

Well, what if I make the changes on the Kelly-Ubuntu branch and commit?  They showed up on Kelly-Ubuntu.  But there were other changes on master, so back to github.  Remember the order of things - Obviously first save, then it will show M(odified), then need to stage changes.  but then can i create the pull rewuest here - think so, but right now i am doing on github.
