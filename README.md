For my next trick I will figure out how Github works more seamlessly with Linux, since downloading a Zip
file seems stupid.

A simple guess for the first step is, not surprisingly to install git.  I think Woohoo - more good guesses, i am on a roll this morning.  The clone box creates the needed arguments for the git command.  And again, very straight forward assumption "git clone" is the base.

Now, i think it can happen automatically if I supply ssh public key.
